# PhysicalComputing
My code for the Physical Computing assignment


Some of the experiments might have websites attached, and these websites can be accessed through the links below, or by hosting the fiels yourself.
These websites will only work on chromium based browsers, which means that firefox and a couple other browsers cannot run them, as they don't implement the required apis.
